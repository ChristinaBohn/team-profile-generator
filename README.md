# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This is a command-line application that will allow users to input information about employees on a software engineering team, and will then create an HTML webpage displaying the team's profiles. This is accomplished using Inquirer in Node.js and includes unit tests, using Jest, for each new type of employee that is constructed.

## What I Learned

I appreciate the ease of using template literals to structure and print text. I first created a sample README.md file containing all of the headers and content needed, and then could copy and paste each part where it was needed into the code.

I learned the importance and usefulness of documentation for resources like Inquirer. There were many options available for questions - I was easily able to find the best fit for the information I wanted to gather to build a README.

One challege I faced was accidentally pushing up a copy of a generated README file, writing over the README for this repo, because of a mistake in naming the new file in the index.js file. This was fixed by adding "sample-" in front of the new README.md file name.

## Usage

You will begin by typing the following into your terminal, to install the inquirer and jest dependencies:

```
npm i
```
And then to run the application and begin building your team:

```
npm start
```
Follow the prompts to enter the content you wish to include in your team's profiles.

To run unit tests, run:

```
npm run test
```
